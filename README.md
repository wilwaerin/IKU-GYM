# IKU-GYM
We create a our school gym website. This project is our private project. We did it independently from our school.


In IKU GYM web site we have 'Home', 'About', 'Contact', 'Blog', 'Product', 'Register' and 'Log in' pages.
User can easily access to home, about and contact pages but cannot access to product and blog pages without login.


In Home page we give motivation words and add some photo you can look and switch photos.
In About page we give some information about our gym.
In Contact page user can contact with us by filling the blanks.
In Blog page we give some information about fitness world.
In Product page user can purchase products about fitness.
In register page user can register to this website.
In Log in page user can log in to the web site and access to Blog and Product pages.

There is also one more page that only admin can access.'Admin' page. 
In Admin page only admin can access. There is a user account called admin can access that page
and admin can see the orders information that other users ordered from Products page.

You have to import IKUGYM.bak folder to your sql because we pull datas from that bak folder.
If you don't pull it you may not see the data (it can be img or text) and you can not log in or register.
Briefly you can't do anything about SQl server with website.
